The [GitLab CLI (`glab`)](https://docs.gitlab.com/cli/) is the canonical way to
install, run, and integrate GitLab Orbit with your AI agent. `glab orbit`
forwards one flat command tree to the managed `orbit` binary. Commands such as
`index`, `grep`, and `sql` use the local graph, while commands such as `query`
and `ontology` use the hosted graph.

The flat `glab orbit` command tree requires `glab` 1.117 or later.

`glab orbit setup` provides guided onboarding, installs the GitLab Orbit skill,
and configures supported AI agents.

## Prerequisites

* `glab` 1.117 or later is installed.
* A local Git repository to index.

The local-graph verbs (`index`, `grep`, `context`, `sql`, `schema`, `list`,
`mcp`, and `repo-map`) require no GitLab account or network connection once the
binary is installed. Hosted verbs (`query`, `status`, `ontology`, `dsl`, `tools`,
and `graph-status`) require an authenticated GitLab account and network access.

## Install

Install the managed `orbit` binary:

shell

```
glab orbit --install
```

`glab` downloads the binary, verifies its checksum, and keeps it up to date.
Verify the install:

shell

```
glab orbit version
```

## Set up your AI agent

`glab orbit setup` configures AI coding agents to consult the graph: it writes a
managed section into each agent’s instruction file and installs the GitLab Orbit
skill.

shell

```
glab orbit setup
```

Run `glab orbit setup --help` for the full option list, including supported
agents and project or user scope.

The binary’s own [`orbit setup`](/orbit/local/access/cli/#set-up-your-ai-agent) also detects
the installed agents, installs the skill, and registers the MCP server with
`--mcp`. `orbit uninstall` reverts it. To connect an MCP client by hand, see
[Connect via MCP](/orbit/local/access/mcp/).

You can also [install the GitLab Orbit skill manually](/orbit/ai_coding_agents/)
with `glab skills install --global orbit`.

## Index a repository

shell

```
glab orbit index /path/to/your/repo
```

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--threads` | Worker thread count. `0` (default) auto-detects from CPU cores. |
| `--stats` | Include detailed statistics in the JSON output. |
| `--verbose` | Verbose logging to stderr. |

## Run SQL against the graph

shell

```
glab orbit sql 'SELECT count(*) FROM gl_definition'
echo 'SELECT name FROM gl_definition LIMIT 3' | glab orbit sql -
```

Table names resolve to the current checkout: run from inside an indexed
repository, `gl_definition`, `gl_file`, and the other node tables contain only
that repository’s indexed commit, and `gl_edge` only that commit’s edges, so
queries need no `project_id` or `commit_sha` predicates. Outside an indexed
checkout the query runs against every indexed commit, with a note on stderr.

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--repo` | Scope the tables to another checkout instead of the current directory. |
| `--all` | Query every indexed repository and commit. |
| `-F`, `--format` | Output format: `table` (default), `json`, `ndjson`, or `csv`. |
| `--db` | Override the DuckDB path. Defaults to `~/.gitlab/orbit/graph.duckdb`. |

## Inspect the schema

`glab orbit schema` lists the graph tables and their columns. The
per-project search-index tables and the schema fingerprint are hidden; name one
explicitly to see it:

shell

```
glab orbit schema
```

Pass table names as positional arguments to scope the output:

shell

```
glab orbit schema gl_definition              # scoped to one table
glab orbit schema gl_definition gl_edge      # scoped to two tables
```

| Flag | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--raw` | Emit JSON instead of the default table view. |
| `--db` | Override the DuckDB path. Defaults to `~/.gitlab/orbit/graph.duckdb`. |

## Run as an MCP server

Expose the local graph to any MCP-compatible AI agent:

shell

```
glab orbit mcp serve
```

It serves `run_sql`, `get_graph_schema`, and `index` over the MCP protocol
against `~/.gitlab/orbit/graph.duckdb`. See [Connect via MCP](/orbit/local/access/mcp/) for the full
agent integration guide.

## Exit codes

`glab orbit` returns `0` on success and a non-zero exit code on failure,
with details on stderr. Scripts and agents can branch on success or failure.

## Billing

The local-graph verbs (`index`, `grep`, `context`, `sql`, `schema`, `list`,
`mcp`, and `repo-map`) process data locally and do not consume GitLab Credits.
Hosted verbs require network access, and `query`
[consumes GitLab Credits](/orbit/remote/access/glab/#billing).
